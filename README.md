# Command line snake in C
 
This is a snake game written in C that can be played in the console.<br>
It has been built and tested on Windows 10 Pro, where it works well in the built-in command line (Visual Studio Code one is weird since it doesn't clear itself completely for some reason).<br>
To run it, navigate the console to the folder where the `snake.exe` file is located and type in `.\snake.exe` (or just `snake.exe`) and hit enter. You can also just double click the exe file, but that won't show the "game over screen".

## Controls
To change the direction of the snake, you have to use wasd (w to go up, a to go left, s to go down, and d to go right).<br>
To exit the game, you can just press x (or ctrl+C).
